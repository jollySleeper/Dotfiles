## ‚ú® Features

## üöÄ Installation
> You will need `git` and GNU `stow`

- Clone this repo into your `$HOME/dotfiles` directory or `~/dotfiles`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jollySleeper/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && cd ~/dotfiles
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To sync configurations, use `stow`, which is a symlink manager that allows you to manage your dotfiles easily. It creates symbolic links from the specified configuration directories in your `dotfiles` repository to the appropriate locations in your home directory. This way, you can keep your configurations organized and easily switch between different setups.

### Single Config
```bash
stow zsh # Just the zsh config
```

### Multiple Configs
```bash
stow alacritty bat neovim # Alacritty, Bat & Neovim Config
```

### Everything
```bash
stow */ # Everything (the '/' ignores the files(Ex: README))
```

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstall

If you decide to uninstall, we're sorry to hear that the settings didn't meet your expectations. We appreciate your feedback. 
To uninstall configurations of an app, run `rm ~/.config/<app_name>` from the terminal, replacing `<app_name>` with the actual name of the application you want to uninstall. After that, you can delete the `dotfiles` folder using the command `rm -r ~/dotfiles`.
